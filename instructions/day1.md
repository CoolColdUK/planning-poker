## Step 1

- starting from my template project, using firebase and monorepo
- run setup with `npx firebase init`
  - use hosting, function, firestore, authentication
  - need enable on firebase
- setup settings and vite working
- haven't test deploy to firebase yet

## Question 1

```
You are developerGPT who speciailise in the following technology
- typescript
- react
- node js
- firebase
- material ui
- css in javascript

I have this new project about developing a progressive web app for planning poker
- user will be able to use google single sign-on to login and create account
- user will be able to create a room
- user will be able to share a link to the room to invite other users
- each user in the room will be able to vote using tshirt sizing
- result will be shown once all user in the room finished their vote
- a graph will be used to show number of vote
- subscription is used to listen to results so all users in the room will see results in real time
```

```
To develop this progressive web app (PWA) for planning poker, you can follow these steps:

1. Set up the development environment:

- Install Node.js and npm (the Node.js package manager).
- Create a new project directory and initialize a new Node.js project with npm init.

2. Create a new React application using the Create React App toolchain:

- Run npx create-react-app planning-poker --template typescript.

3. Add required dependencies:

- Install Material-UI: npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled.
- Install Firebase: npm install firebase.
- Install React Router for navigation: npm install react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom.

4. Set up Firebase:

- Create a new project on the Firebase Console.
- Enable Google Sign-In authentication.
- Set up Firestore for storing rooms and votes.
- Create a firebaseConfig.ts file and import and initialize Firebase with the configuration details from the Firebase Console.

5. Create components for the application:

- App.tsx: Main application component.
- Login.tsx: Login page with Google Sign-In button.
- RoomCreation.tsx: Form for creating a room.
- Room.tsx: Room component for voting and displaying results.
- TshirtSize.tsx: Component for rendering T-shirt size buttons.
- VoteGraph.tsx: Component for rendering a graph of votes.

6. Set up React Router for navigation between components in `App.tsx`.

7. Implement Google Sign-In functionality in the `Login.tsx` component using Firebase.

8. Implement room creation in the `RoomCreation.tsx` component:

- Create a new document in the Firestore collection for rooms.
- Generate a unique room ID and store the room details in Firestore.

9. Implement room joining functionality:

- Allow users to enter a room ID or click a shared link.
- Retrieve room details from Firestore and validate the ID.

10. Implement voting functionality in the `Room.tsx` component:

- Create a Firestore collection for votes within the room document.
- Allow users to cast votes using T-shirt sizing.
- Store each vote as a document in the Firestore votes collection.

11. Implement real-time subscription to voting results:

- Use Firestore's onSnapshot method to listen for changes in the votes collection.
- Update the application state and display the voting results.

12. Implement the `VoteGraph.tsx` component to visualize voting results as a graph.

13. Test the application thoroughly and fix any bugs or issues.

14. Deploy the application to a hosting platform like Firebase Hosting or Netlify.

15. Configure the PWA by adding a `manifest.json` file and a service worker for offline support and caching.

Following these steps, you'll have a fully functional progressive web app for planning poker.
```

## Question 2

I have done the following

- setup firebase with firestore in native mode, authentication with firebase, hosting with firebase
- use mono repo structure
- ci/cd with firebase init
- vite server can now start
- installed react and react-dom

Effectively I have completed all steps including step 5. What is the code required for step 6 App.tsx?

## Question 3

Function component is not a function declarationeslintreact/function-component-definition)

maybe use `export default function` instead for the component?

## Question 4

I have modified your code to look like this
```
import {GoogleAuthProvider, onAuthStateChanged, signInWithPopup, User} from 'firebase/auth';
import {useEffect, useState} from 'react';
import {firebaseAuth} from '../firebaseConfig';

export default function App() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = onAuthStateChanged(firebaseAuth, (returnedUser) => {
      setUser(returnedUser);
    });
    return () => unsubscribe();
  }, []);

  const signInWithGoogle = async () => {
    const provider = new GoogleAuthProvider();
    try {
      await signInWithPopup(firebaseAuth, provider);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  };

  const signOut = async () => {
    try {
      await signOut();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      {user ? (
        <>
          <h1>Welcome, {user.displayName}</h1>
          <button onClick={signOut}>Sign out</button>
        </>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={signInWithGoogle}>Sign in with Google</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

```
I have made the following changes
- extract config to another file
- use latest version of firebase@9, which uses functional components

Can you modify the code to use mui components instead? do not use raw html element if possible
Can you add theme and css baseline to the code
can you center the content to the screen?

## Question 5

I am using material ui 5, the `import {createTheme} from '@mui/system';` is wrong. createTheme needs to be imported directly from @mui/material.

Now, lets work on the Login.tsx page. Do I move the login content from app.tsx to login.tsx, or is there anything else I need to put in there? we will also need to get the react router working
